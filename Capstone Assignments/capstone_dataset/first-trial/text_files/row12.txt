About Remedy RoboticsCardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Much of this could be prevented with better access to specialist care. Take stroke as an example: any delay in treatment can lead to permanent disability or death. However, due to a lack of specialist surgeons, the most effective intervention can only be performed in 2% of US hospitals. For patients who present to one of the 98% of hospitals that do not offer the surgery, treatment is either significantly delayed or not offered at all because timely transfer is not feasible.Our mission is to bring state-of-the-art vascular intervention to anyone, anytime, regardless of their location. Our team of medical clinicians, roboticists, and machine learning experts are working to bridge this gap by building the world’s first remotely-operated, semi-autonomous endovascular surgical robot.We’ve already done what nobody else could—using our system, doctors from around the world were able to remotely perform this procedure from as far as 8000 miles away. We now need your help to bring this technology out of the laboratory and into hospitals everywhere.The RoleWe’re looking for someone to continue leveraging our vast trove of medical imaging data in order to train and deploy deep neural network models. These models enable our surgical robot to understand and reason about both our robot and the patient’s anatomy, which ultimately gives doctors the insight and control necessary to quickly and safely complete the procedure.You WillTrain deep neural networks to detect salient features in medical imaging dataUnderstand and interpret the training data distributions and labels, and their effect on model performanceDevelop metrics that reveal neural network performance, thereby providing actionable information for improving the modelsDeploy trained neural networks on a real-time surgical robotic systemYou Have2+ years of machine learning engineering experienceExpertise with PythonExperience training image-based deep neural networks, includingEagerness to learn on the job, iterate fast, and collaborateNice to HavesStrong background in linear algebra, multivariable calculus, or optimizationExperience with cloud infrastructure toolsExpertise with deep neural networks for unsupervised learning, such as VAEs or GANs
