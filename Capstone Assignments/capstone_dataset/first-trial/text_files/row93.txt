EMC is one of the National Weather Service’s (NWS) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) located at the NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction (NCWCP) in College Park, MD. EMC is responsible for developing and transitioning into operation state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems providing guidance to the NWS weather, sub-seasonal, and seasonal forecasts. Modern systems are based on coupled Earth system models developed collaboratively within NOAA and with other research partners. EMC is involved in all phases of scientific and engineering model development including data ingest, data assimilation, model integration, post-processing, product generation, validation, and verification.What Will You DoNumerical weather prediction (NWP) applications use complex end-to-end workflows to drive the NWP modeling systems and generate forecast guidance. The successful candidate will contribute to the design, development, optimization, and maintenance of NWP workflows running on High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Cloud platforms, as part of highly motivated, multidisciplinary teams including software engineers and physical scientists in an Agile-style environment. These activities are finalized to develop new capabilities and modernize current infrastructure to fulfill the requirements for the planned NOAA’s Seasonal Forecast System (SFS).ResponsibilitiesDesign, develop, and maintain workflow features to enable seamless deployment of NWPapplications to HPC and Cloud-based platformsFollow software development best practicesDevelop flexible software frameworks to efficiently utilize both HPC resources and Cloudplatforms for numerical weather forecastingIdentify and address bottlenecks in the codebase to improve overall system performance ondiverse computing architecturesWork closely with cross-functional teams in an Agile-style development environment to achieveproject milestones and deliver high-quality softwareCreate clear and comprehensive documentation for software and processesQualificationsQualificationsBackground in Physical Sciences, Computer Sciences, or Mathematics with proven experience in numerical modeling.Experience with Python and Unix Shell ScriptingKnowledge of Object Oriented Programming concepts with emphasis on the development of efficient and scalable code.
